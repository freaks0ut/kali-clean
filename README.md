# Kali-Clean

This is the kali i3 installation by xct. I updated the installation add added some features to optimize it for working with a MacBook Pro 14''.

After cloning the repo just run ./install.sh from a non-root user. This updates kali and installs a lot of stuff, so it will take a while. Feel free to optimize ;)

## Installation

```
./install.sh
```

After the script is done reboot and select i3 (top right corner) on the login screen.

## Display Scaling

```
./i3-scale.sh
```

Just run the script and enter the scaling values to adjust the i3 elements to fit your setup.
